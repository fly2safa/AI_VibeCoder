CRUD operations
create, read, update, delete songs

When I use the app, I want to be able to specify "who" I am (username)
and then add a song, or list all songs. Or, if I request a specific song, or
make a search of   my songs.  I also want to track this in a "history".

For instance "Safa" played "song 1".
